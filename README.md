### Deliverable 1 Written Summary

- vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a non-random about of variance to the mpg values in the the dataset
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. See the vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide a positive slope.
- This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The Multiple R^2 is 5.35e-11, smaller than 0.5.
